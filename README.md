# The Boring Show / Replicated!

I find that I learn things better if I do them myself. 

This is an effort to code along with episodes of the [The Boring Show](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLOU2XLYxmsIK0r_D-zWcmJ1plIcDNnRkK) so I can better understand how to structure/architect complex apps in Flutter.

The Boring Show focuses on building a Hacker News Clone.

As a bonus project, I will use insights from this replication effort to build a similar app for a new data source and/ordomain. This ensures that any knowledge I gain from this exercise does in fact "translate" to new projects.


## Episode 1: The Pilot Episode

1. Scaffolded a blank app. ```flutter create --org flutter.fyi hn_app```


2. Opened an iOS Simulator for testing. ```open -a Simulator```. Verified that scaffolded app worked.

3. Cleaned up boilerplate to reduce to basic screen (with Scaffold, AppBar and center text. No FAB or counter). _Checked in_
